In this assignment, you will implement a small project in Java as a team.

The functional requirements for this project are below:
The system shall look like a regular calculator. [MediumPriority]
The system shall only have two buttons for numbers: 0 and 1. [HighPriority]
The system can do operations with two numbers like below. [HighPriority]
The user shall enter a binary number, then press an operation button, then enter another number, finally pressing the 'equal' button shall display the result of the operation.
These operations shall be addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
The system shall work on only integer values. [MediumPriority]
The system can do operations with one number like below. [LowPriority]
The user shall enter a binary number, then pressing an operation button shall display the result of the operation.
These operations shall be square and square-root.
The system shall have a visible display for the entered numbers and the result of the operation. [HighPriority]
The display shall view the number both in binary and in decimal by using a toggle button. [MediumPriority]
The non-functional requirements for this project are below:
The system shall be implemented in IntelliJ Idea and JDK >=12.
UI and logic should be separate.
The logic part should be unit-tested!
The system shall have a gitignore file to ignore the temporary files.
This file may be created automatically on https://www.gitignore.io/ (Links to an external site.) 
One of the team members shall create a repository and add others as collaborators.
The repository shall have a README.md file for explanations of the project.
This file shall have screenshots of the project and a small manual on how to use the calculator.
If there are additional dependencies needed, these should be explained in the readme file as well.
The task will be divided into the number of team members and each team member MUST commit to the project.
The task distribution shall be noted in the readme file of the repository in the format of [name of team member] = [task of the team member] in each line.
The instructor will analyze the commit history for each team member's contribution.
All meetings will be noted in the readme file as well.
Date/time of the meeting, who attended, medium, what has been discussed.
Any clarifications shall be made by the instructor only when the team asks.
The project shall be graded based on both functional and non-functional requirements.
They are equally important.
The submission shall be the URL of the repository.
Try cloning/running the project on multiple computers. If errors are faced while grading, you will lose points.
Team members
Find your team members under People link on the left, the same name as the assignment name and a number.
This is a new team than the previous team assignments.
You can create a public Slack channel for your team in this assignment to communicate with them and arrange meetings.
Please name them as the same name as your team here.
These channels will be deleted after this assignment.
No team member left behind.
If someone is unresponsive: first Slack DM two times at some interval, then email using the group page on Canvas, then tell the instructor.
If someone is intentionally left behind, other members are responsible for it.
